        <h1>Hello!</h1>
        <p>
          Welcome to my website. My name is Janelle and I love making things in
          <a href="/cssfun.html">CSS</a>.

        <h2>BACKSTORY</h2>
        <p>
          I have a degree in botany and worked on a fruit and veggie farm for 18
          years until the owners retired. Because of a recurring shoulder injury
          I didn't look for another farm job but instead decided to learn front
          end web development. And you may ask what business does some farm
          worker have designing websites? And to that I say “have you seen my
          <a href="pumpkins.html">pumpkins</a>?!”
        </p>
        <p>
          Alas I spend far too much time trying to recreate interesting layouts
          I see in anime with CSS and svgs, rather than learning the ins and
          outs of javascript.
