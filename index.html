        <h2>BACKSTORY</h2>
        <p class="p-space">
          I have a degree in botany and worked on a fruit and veggie farm for 18
          years until the owners retired. Because of a recurring shoulder injury
          I didn't look for another farm job but instead decided to learn front
          end web development. And you may ask what business does some farm
          worker have designing websites? And to that I say “have you seen my
          <a href="pumpkins.html">pumpkins</a>?!”
        </p>
        <p>
          Alas I spend far too much time trying to recreate interesting layouts
          I see in
          <button popovertarget="ranmaPop" popovertargetaction="show">
            anime
          </button>
          with CSS and svgs, rather than learning the ins and outs of
          javascript.
        </p>
        <div id="ranmaPop" popover class="ranma">
          <p>This page was inspired by...</p>
          <h3>RANMA 1/2</h3>
          <img
            src="assets/photos/ranma-inspiration.jpg"
            alt="image from 'ranma
          1/2' with very similar backgrounds to my homepage"
          />
          <button popovertarget="ranmaPop" popovertargetaction="hide" autofocus>
            CLOSE
