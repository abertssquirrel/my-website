			<h2>BACKSTORY</h2>
			<p class="p-space">
			  I have a degree in botany and worked on a fruit and veggie farm for 18
			  years. Because of a recurring shoulder injury
			  I decided to learn front end web development. And you may ask what business does some farm
			  worker have designing websites? And to that I say “have you seen my
			  <a href="pumpkins.html">pumpkins</a>?!”
			</p>
			<p>
			  Alas I spend far too much time trying to recreate interesting layouts
			  I see in
			  <button popovertarget="ranmaPop" popovertargetaction="show">
				anime
			  </button>
			  with CSS and svgs, rather than learning the ins and outs of
			  javascript.

			<div id="ranmaPop" popover class="ranma">

			  <h3>RANMA 1/2</h3>
			  <img
				src="assets/photos/ranma-inspiration.jpg"
				alt="image from 'ranma
			  1/2' with very similar backgrounds to my homepage"
			  />
			  <button popovertarget="ranmaPop" popovertargetaction="hide" autofocus>
